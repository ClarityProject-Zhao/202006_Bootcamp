- Week 2: Web scraping

During this week, I reviewed linear algebra and EDA, and studied web scraping related knowlege and tools (html, Beautifulsoup, Regex). 
For practice, I scraped Airbnb Online Experience, the newly launched Airbnb service since Covid, and collected data including location, price,
length, rating, number of reviews for all the online experiences that are being offered right now. After saving the data in a pandas dataframe, 
I did some simple EDA as I was interested to see the regional differences in the quantity, price and popularity of the experiences, 
what tend to impact the popularity and prices of the events, and whether there is any correlation among them.
