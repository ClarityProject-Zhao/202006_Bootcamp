- Week 2: Web scraping

During this week, I reviewed linear algebra and EDA, and studied web scraping related knowledge and tools (html, Beautifulsoup, Regex). 
For practice, I scraped Airbnb online experience site, the newly launched Airbnb service since Covid, and collect data including location, price,
length, rating, and the number of reviews for all the online experiences that are currently available. After saving the data in a pandas dataframe, 
I did some simple EDA as I was interested in seeing the regional differences in the quantity, price and popularity of the online events, 
and whether there is any correlation among them.

- Week 3: probabiliy and statistics

I reviewed some of the most important concepts in probability and statistics this week, including frequentist vs. bayesian, MLE vs. MAP. As a practice, I simulated some sample data and tried estimation using both MLE and MAP. Aside from going over the commonly used probability distribution functions, I dived deeper into Naive Bayes and implemented an NB classifier for text analysis.
