The focus this week is plotting. During the week, I reviewed/studied a number of tools including matplotlib, 
seaborn, plotly and D3. 

For the project, I visualized covid cases using different libraries. Aside from plotting the basic line charts using matplotlib, 
seaborn and plotly, I used plotly to create an animated trace race chart to show the development of cases over time.
I was deeply intrigued by the power of these packages, especially plotly and D3. While I don't have a lot of time to go
much deeper this week, I am looking forward to come back to the visualization session after the Bootcamp.

Data is beautiful!
